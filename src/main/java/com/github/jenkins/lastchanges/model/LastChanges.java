/**
 * This class represents the changes between two trees (in git) and two revisions (in svn).
 *
 * currentRevision gathers the information from latest commit on the newest tree (in git) and most recent revision (in
 * svn)
 *
 * previousRevision has the information of the most recent commit in previous tree (in git) and most recent commit (in
 * svn)
 *
 * diff is the differences between those trees (in git) or revisions (in svn)
 *
 * commits is the list of commits between those revisions/trees. Each commit has the commit information (as in
 * current/previous revisions) as well as the diff compared to it's previous revision.
